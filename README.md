This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About

This is a basic project I made to start learning NextJs with typescript using the 
PokeApi.


## Getting Started

First, install the dependecies:


```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
